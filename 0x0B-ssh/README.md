- ### Server computing

	- A server is a computer that provides information to other computers, clients on a network.

	- Such an architecture forms what is generally termed as a client-server model.

	- Typical servers include ___database servers___, ___file servers___, ___mail servers___, ___web servers___, ___print servers___ and ___application servers___.

	- In a client-server model, a client sends a request to the server and the server responds back with a response to the client. 

	- Table below outlines different servers:


		| Server type 		| Purpose 			| clients 		|
		|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
		| **Application server** | - Host's application `back ends` that user clients (__front ends__, __web apps__, or __locally installed applications__) in the network connect to and use. \n- Not necessarily connected to the internet, even a local network can do | Clients with a browser or a local front end, or a web server. |
		| Catalog server | Maintains an index or table of contents that can be found across a large distributed network, such as computers, users, files shared on file servers and web apps. | Any computer program that needs to find something on the network e.g email client looking for an email address |
		| Communications server | Maintains an environment needed for one communication endpoint to find other endpoints and communicate with them. | Communication endpoints |
		| **Computing server** | Shares vast amounts of computing resources, especially CPU and RAM over a network. | Any computer that needs more CPU power and RAM than a personal computer. Works especially great amongst networked computers. |
		| **Database server** | Maintains and shares any form of a database over a network. | spreadsheets, accounting software, asset management software or any program that consumes organized data, especially in large volumes. |
		| Fax server | shares one or more fax machines over a network, thus eliminating the hassle of physical access | Any fax sender or recipient |
		| **File server** | Shares files and folders, storage space to hold files and folders, or both over a network | Networked computers |
		| Game server | Enables several computers or gaming devices to play multiplayer video games | Personal computers and gaming consoles |
		| **Mail server** | Makes email communication possible | Senders and recipients of mail |
		| Media server | Shares digital video or digital audio over a network through media streaming. | User-attended personal computers. |
		| **Print server** | Shares one or more printers over a network, eliminating the hassle of physical access. | Computers in need of printing something. |
		| Sound server | Enables computer programs to play and record sound | Computer programs of the same computer and network clients. |
		| **Proxy server** | Acts as an intermediary between a client and a server, accepting incoming traffic from the client and sending it to the server. May be done to control traffic and filter, prevent unauthorized network access or just routing the traffic over a large and complex network. | Any networked computer |
		| **Virtual server** | shares hardware and software resources with other virtual servers. | Any networked computer |
		| **Web server** | Host web pages. A single one could also host multiple websites. | Computers with a web browser |
