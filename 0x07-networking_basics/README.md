- ### Networks:

- A common way to categorize computer networks is through the `scope` or `scale` of the network:

- #### Types of Area Networks:

	1. __LAN:__ - Local Area Network.
	2. __WAN:__ - Wide Area Network.
	3. __WLAN:__ - Wireless Local Area Network.
	4. __MAN:__ - Metropolitan Area Network.
	5. __SAN:__ - Storage/System/Server/Small  Area Network.
	6. __CAN:__ - Campus/Controller/Cluster Area Network.
	7. __PAN:__ - Personal Area Network.

  Of all these, `LAN` and `WAN` are the two primary and best-known categories of networks, based on the scale/scope of the network. The other categories have merged with technological advances.



- #### LAN: Local Area Network

- Connects network devices over a relatively short distance, e.g an office building, school or home.
- Are typically owned, controlled and managed by a single person or organization.


- #### WAN: Wide Area Netework

- Spans a large physical distance. (The ___internet___ is the largest WAN, spanning the earth).
- Is basically a geographically-dispersed collection of LANs interconnected through ***routers***.
- Most are not owned by one organization, instead, exist under collective or distributed ownership and management, point in case, the internet.



- #### Home Networking and Other types of Area Networks.

- Residences typically employ one LAN and connect to the internet(WAN) through an `internet service provider`, ___ISP___ using a broadband `modem`.

- The ISP provides a WAN IP address to the modem and all computers connected to the home network use LAN IP addresses (also known as private IP addresses) to connect to the WAN.

- All computers on a home LAN can communicate directly with each other but must go through a central `netwok gateway`, typically a `broadband router` to reach the ISP and beyond.

- #### Other network variants:

	1.  Wireless Local Area Network(___WLAN___): A LAN that is just based on `Wi-Fi` wireless network technology.

	2. Metropolitan Area Network: A network spanning an area larger than that of a LAN but smaller than that of a WAN, such as a network within a city. Typically owned and managed by a single entity such as a government body or large corporation.

	3. Campus Area Network: A network spanning multiple LANs but smaller than a MAN, such as a university or local business campus.

	4. Personal Area Network: A network that surrounds an individual. A wireless PAN (___WPAN___) might be created between bluetooth devices.

	5. Storage Area Network: Connects servers to data storage devices through technology like `Fibre Channel`.

	6. System Area Network, also Cluster Area Network(___CAN___): Links high-performance computers with high-speed connections in a cluster configuration.

	7. Passive Optical Local Area Network(___POLAN___): Serves fiber by using fiber optic splitters to allow a single `optical fiber` to serve multiple devices.


	- Note that there's also networks focused on private networks e.g `virtual private networks(VPNs)` and `Enterprise private networks(EPNs)`
