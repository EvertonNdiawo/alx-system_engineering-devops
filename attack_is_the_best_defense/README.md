## Attack is the best defense

- ### Network Sniffing

	- Involves the use of softwares or hardware running these softwares, a network sniffer, to monitor or sniff the data flowing over a computer network in real-time.

	- Network sniffers generally take snapshot copies of the data that is flowing over a network without altering or redirecting it.
	
	- Network sniffers are also known as network probes, wireless sniffers, Ethernet sniffers, packet sniffers, packet analyzers, or snoops.



	- #### How network sniffing works

		- A packet sniffer intercepts all the data flowing over the network it is connected.

		- For instance, in a local LAN setting, computers are connected to other computers within the network and are generally configured to ignore traffick that is not directed to them and their IP addresses. A network sniffer on such a network opens up to all traffic by opening up the computer's NIC to listen to that traffic. Once the network data is accessed, a packet sniffer performs the following actions:

			1. The contents or individual packets are recorded.

			2. Captured network data is then decoded and formatted so that the user can  view theis information. Packet sniffers analyze errors in a network communication, troubleshoot the network connections and reconstruct entire data streams intended for other computers.

			3. some network sniffing software retrieve sensitive information like passwords, PINs and private information.
